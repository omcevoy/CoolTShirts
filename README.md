# CoolTShirts - Touch Attribution

**TLDR**: I used SQL to perform a touch attribution analysis of a marketing campaign

This project was completed as a part of the Codecademy Data Science Path. The problem at hand here is the CoolTShirts, an apparel company, recently began a few marketing campaigns with the intention of driving additional traffic to their website. The goal is to optimize their marketing campaigns using touch attribution, to see which campaigns generate the most clicks and purchases.
